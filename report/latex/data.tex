For this project, I will primarily be using the SynthRAD\cite{synthradData} dataset, which is a relatively large collection of 3D CT and T1 MRI scan pairs. That is, this dataset consists of 180 pairs of CT and MRI scans which are already preprocessed and registered, making it a potentially incredibly useful dataset for training models on.
