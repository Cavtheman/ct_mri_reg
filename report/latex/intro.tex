In recent years, the segmentation of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become very accurate, and can be used to diagnose many health issues. However, MRI faces a few problems; namely that it is time consuming and expensive compared to other scans. As such, it is desirable for cheaper and quicker scans such as computed tomography (CT) to be automatically registered to an MRI.\@ The purpose of the project is exactly that. If successful, this would allow such scans to take place in situations where time is of the essence and help medical personnel in taking more informed decisions.
