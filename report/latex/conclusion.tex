In this paper, we successfully created a method of automatically registering CT scans to T1 MRI scans, demonstrating that the multi-modal capabilities of the Synthmorph network can be extended beyond the various modalities of MRI scans to CT scans as well. Through various evaluation methods, we have also shown that this extra capability did not seem to come at the expense of poorer MRI to MRI registration performance.

However, we have also demonstrated that the Synthmorph network itself it likely not yet good enough to be of use in clinical settings in practice.
