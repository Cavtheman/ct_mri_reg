  This paper investigates an extension of the SynthMorph network (Hoffmann et al. 2022)\cite{synthmorphModel} with additional capabilities, namely cross-domain registration. The network is originally designed for multi-modal MRI registration, but in this paper we train it to also handle CT to MRI registration. We train the network to do this using only the affine transformation matrices generated by the network. This CT-MRI registration capability could help combine the rapid imaging capabilities of CT scans, and the soft tissue details of MRI scans.

  While our findings suggest that the SynthMorph shows promise for cross-modal registration, we believe it will likely need further refinement to be a clinically viable tool. We show that currently the performance does not live up to the standards required in practice yet.
  %This paper investigates the extension of the SynthMorph network, originally designed for multi-modal MRI registration, to handle cross-domain CT-MRI registration. We evaluate the performance of SynthMorph in registering CT scans to T1 MRI scans, aiming to leverage the rapid imaging capabilities of CT and the detailed soft tissue contrast of MRI. Despite the successful application of SynthMorph to various MRI modalities, our results indicate that the network, without fine-tuning, performs significantly worse in CT-MRI registration. Specifically, our fine-tuned model achieved a mean Dice score of 0.3312 in white matter segmentation, compared to the over 0.6 Dice score reported in the original SynthMorph paper for MRI-MRI registrations. This discrepancy highlights the challenges inherent in cross-domain registration, particularly in clinical applications. While our tuned models demonstrated improvements, the overall performance suggests that further refinement and perhaps novel approaches may be required to meet clinical standards. Future work should explore the generalization of this model to other imaging modalities and investigate techniques to mitigate model-induced hallucinations, particularly in the context of diffusion models.
