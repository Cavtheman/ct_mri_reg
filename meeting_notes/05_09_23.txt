Regular meeting: Monday 13:30

Meeting Agenda:
        Meeting time
        Data access
        SoTA paper
        Report


ADNI dataset - Alzheimers disease dataset
     Write to the authors to get access?
     Not allowed to share, but free to use

Data: CT and TI MRI 3D scans, along with some other pieces of data
We have registered pairs of images, can create artificially unaligned data with known registration parameters. Can use SoTA tool and can find error of this. Then train model and validate to find error and compare with SoTA. This is the first step. Registration will be 3D, but can start with 2D

60/20/20 train/val/test

Read Nicole's thesis in the meantime while Mostafa finds data
Literature search for MR to CT registration
     Make note of which datasets papers use and whether data is public
SoTA registration will fall into two categories:
     Move images around
     Deep Learning (either parameter estimation or direct registration, sometimes generative)

Report (scientific paper):
        Intro (1pg)
        Methods
           Data
           Computational methods (often large part)
           Eval criteria + statistics
        Results
           Data
           Accuracy
           Eval criteria + statistics
        Discussion
        (Limitations)
        Conclusion

MICCAI 2023 format is a potential style for report
Write thesis such that it has:
      Synopsis 4-10pg
        Background
        Motivation
        Research question
      Scientific paper
      Supplementary material

Structure is such that the middle can be "cut out" and potentially published

I should set agendas for next meetings
