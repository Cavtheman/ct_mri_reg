Before:
Handling padding and edges? Reflect, crop, other method?
Normalising images between 0 and 1?
Nice libraries and tools for registration?
I'll give an update on progress with RIRE dataset

After:
Resolution: interpolate as few times as possible
Do interpolation as the very last step
simpleitk is alright to use
Registration should work with different resolutions
Padding is fine, registration should handle the scaling
Padding should work for everything, except in cases where resolutions are wildly different
Look at the synthrad dataset maybe
Mutual Information may not be a good metric?

If normalising and padding, normalise before padding

ct scan intesnsity is physical measure, so measures should be the same across machines, normalising
next step is deregistration for the artificial dataset

Look at different interpolation methods
linear or nearest neighbour interpolation might be worth looking at
linear interpolation may lead to the rotation being directly measurable

Picking a random interpolator during deregistration may be worth it
Investigate effects of different interpolators

Limit the rotation to <15-20 degrees because it would never be seen irl
Keep augmentation "realistic"
